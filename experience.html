        <h2>My Experience</h2>
        <p>I am currently enrolled in my second web design course. This one is much more expensive than the first one and will take a lot longer to finish.</p>
        <p>Iâ€™ve worked at a recording studio and a video store and have until very recently assumed I would get over myself and find some kind of work as a professional writer. It turns out there are more website maker jobs than professional writing jobs, though, so I'm doing this instead. I think being a website designer who can write the hell out of some copy is a pretty good selling point, though.</p>
